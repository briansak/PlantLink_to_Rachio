# PlantLink_to_Rachio
Manual integration to trigger Rachio to water a particular zone based on a low moisture reading from the PlantLink soil sensor.

This script will allow you to read the soil moisture from the PlantLink soil sensor and if the reading indicates that the plant/grass needs to be watered, it will trigger your Rachio Iro irrigation system to water that zone for a definable amount of time.

Some pre-work is needed to gather your Auth Token and Zone IDs from Rachio to plug into the script.  See my blog post to determine how to identify these values.
